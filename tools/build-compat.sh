# build-compat.sh -- build libamixc99.a, the parts of a C library that AMIX
# SVR4.0 does not have, and install it into the toolchain.
#
# It is installed rather than left in a build directory, and named in the
# compiler's own lib spec, because these are libc functions: code that calls
# snprintf should link, without every project having to know that this target
# needs an extra library.  That is also why the name says what it is -- the C99
# and POSIX pieces AMIX predates -- rather than naming a project.
#
# Not a Makefile: config.sh is shell, and a Makefile that `include`s it gets the
# quotes as part of the value.
#
# The name is deliberately not libamixcompat.a: another AMIX cross toolchain
# installs one of those into the shared sysroot, holding syscall wrappers and
# floating-point control, and overwriting it would break every other project
# using that sysroot.
