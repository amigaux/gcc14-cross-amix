# build-cross.sh -- build a modern C and C++ cross compiler for AMIX.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# AMIX's own toolchain is gcc 2.7.2.3: no C++ at all, no -m68060, no C99.  The
# port needs C++03, so a compiler has to be built either way -- and the same
# build hands us a modern C compiler for free.
#
# WHY --target=m68k-elf AND NOT A NEW m68k-amix TARGET
# ----------------------------------------------------
# GCC dropped every m68k SVR4 target years ago (GCC 14 has elf, netbsdelf,
# uclinux, linux, rtems and nothing else), so an "m68k-amix" triple would need a
# config.gcc patch we would then carry forever.  We do not need one: measured
# against the machine's own binaries, the plain m68k ELF ABI *is* the AMIX ABI.
# What AMIX-specific knowledge exists lives in tools/amix-cc.sh instead, where
# it is one file to read rather than a patch to rebase.
#
# WHY m68k-elf RATHER THAN THE PACKAGED m68k-linux-gnu COMPILER
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Debian's m68k-linux-gnu g++ cannot give us working C++ exceptions here: its
# libgcc_eh.a resolves _dl_find_object and the whole pthread_* family, none of
# which AMIX has.  Those come from the glibc-flavoured unwinder, which locates
# exception tables by asking the dynamic loader.  An elf target instead builds
# the registry unwinder, where crtbegin registers .eh_frame from .init at
# startup and no loader support is needed -- and --disable-threads turns the
# pthread locking into no-ops.  That is the whole reason to build our own.
#
# Usage:  toolchain/build-cross.sh [--jobs N]
# Reads AMIX_SYSROOT from config.sh; installs into $TC_PREFIX (see below).

	# --disable-gcov: libgcov wants MAP_ANONYMOUS and intptr_t, and SVR4.0 has
	#   neither.  Coverage instrumentation is not something this port needs, and
	#   without this the libgcc build stops in _gcov_merge_topn.o.
	# --disable-multilib: the m68k-elf target otherwise builds ~15 multilibs,
	#   almost all of them ColdFire.  Each one would get its own libgcc and its
	#   own libstdc++; on a host with a few gigabytes free that fills the disk
	#   before the build finishes.  One library serves the whole 68020..68060
	#   range, which is every machine this port targets.
	# --with-cpu=68060: NOT a performance choice, a correctness one.  libgcc's
	#   __udivmoddi4 compiled for a 68020 uses divul / divull / mulul -- the
	#   32x64 divide and 64-bit multiply forms the 68060 REMOVED.  On the target
	#   machine, a 68060, they trap as unimplemented integer instructions, and
	#   with no ISP handler in the kernel the process dies with SIGKILL.
	#   Measured: any 64-bit divide by a NON-CONSTANT killed the process, while
	#   dividing by a constant was fine because GCC folds that into a multiply
	#   and never calls libgcc -- which is what made it look like a bug in the
	#   caller.  Telling GCC the CPU is a 68060 makes it avoid those
	#   instructions everywhere, libgcc included, and the result still runs on
	#   68020/030/040 because it only ever avoids instructions, never adds any.
	#   This has to be the compiler DEFAULT: passing CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET does not
	#   reach libgcc's own compile (measured -- the instructions survived).
	# libstdc++ is built HOSTED -- containers, strings, the lot -- which is why
	#   patch-libstdcxx-configure.py above has to tell its configure what the
	#   AMIX C library declares.  See docs/TOOLCHAIN.md section 13.
