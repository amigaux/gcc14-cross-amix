# rebuild-target-libs.sh -- rebuild libgcc and libstdc++ after a change that
# affects code generation or the target headers.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT FOUR COMMANDS
# ------------------------------------------
# Every step here was got wrong by hand first, and none of the three mistakes
# announced itself as a mistake:
#
#   1. `make -j4 all-target-libgcc install-target-libgcc` installs IN PARALLEL
#      with building, so install ran first and failed with "cannot read
#      libgcc.a".  Independent top-level goals are not ordered by make.
#   2. The build tree's xgcc reads `build-gcc/gcc/include-fixed`, not the
#      installed one.  Without it, libstdc++ compiles against the sysroot's raw
#      K&R headers and dies on `sys/stat.h` -- and the error names the sysroot
#      path, which looks like a broken sysroot rather than a missing copy.
#   3. Fixing (2) and re-running only the failed step leaves the objects from
#      before the fix in place.  They link, and the failure appears later as
#      `undefined reference to _Z4freePv` -- a C++-mangled `free`, from a
#      translation unit compiled before the `extern "C"` wrappers were visible.
#
# So the order is: specs, then headers, then a CLEAN of both libraries, then
# build and install strictly sequentially.  A partial rebuild of these two
# libraries is worse than no rebuild, because it produces an archive that is
# half one ABI and half the other and still links.
#
# Usage: toolchain/rebuild-target-libs.sh
