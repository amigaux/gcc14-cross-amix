# install-specs.sh -- turn the generic m68k-elf compiler into an AMIX compiler.
#
# WHY
# ---
# GCC has no m68k SVR4 target any more, so build-cross.sh configures the generic
# m68k-elf one.  Its specs are bare: startfile is just crtbegin.o, lib is just
# -lc, link is empty.  So `m68k-elf-gcc -o prog prog.c` fails with
# "cannot find -lc" -- AMIX keeps its link-time libc stub in usr/ccs/lib, which
# is not on the default search path -- and even if it linked, the result would
# have no process entry point, no interpreter and the wrong text address.
#
# That is not just an inconvenience.  libstdc++'s configure runs link tests; a
# compiler that cannot link makes it set GCC_NO_EXECUTABLES and then abort with
# "Link tests are not allowed after GCC_NO_EXECUTABLES", which is exactly where
# the first build of this toolchain stopped.
#
# A specs file is the supported way to retarget a GCC without patching it: the
# driver reads $libdir/specs in preference to its built-in strings.  Everything
# below is guarded on %{!nostdlib:...}, so tools/amix-cc.sh -- which passes
# -nostdlib and names every object itself -- keeps full control and is
# unaffected by what is written here.
#
# %R expands to the configured sysroot, so the file stays portable between
# machines.

# The platform identifies itself.  A generic m68k-elf compiler defines nothing
# that says "AMIX", so portable code has no way to select a path for this
# target -- and code that IS written for it, like a crash handler that reads
# the fault PC out of a ucontext, silently compiles to nothing instead.  The
# usual three spellings, as every Unix port does it.

# AMIX's system headers are C89 and declare plenty of functions with no return
# type -- X11R5's Xlib.h alone does it for most of the library.  GCC 14 made
# implicit int an ERROR, so a stock compiler cannot include <X11/Xlib.h> on this
# target at all.  Demoted to a warning, and ONLY this one: implicit function
# declarations stay an error, because those come from call sites in our own code
# rather than from the vendor's headers, and letting them through would hide the
# exact class of mistake this target punishes hardest.
# -malign-int IS THE ABI, not a tuning flag.
#
# AMIX's cc rounds a struct up to 4 bytes; m68k GCC rounds to 2.  libc's own
# stdio array settles it: __iob is 320 bytes with _NFILE 20, so its stride is
# 16, and its FILE is int + pointer + pointer + uchar + uchar, which GCC makes
# 14 bytes.  So `stdout`, which is the macro `&__iob[1]`, is __iob+14 in our
# code and __iob+16 in libc's -- two bytes off for stdout and four for stderr.
#
# What that looks like is not a crash.  printf works, because GCC turns it into
# puts and libc indexes its own array correctly.  fprintf(stdout, ...) becomes
# fwrite on a FILE two bytes short of the real one, reads flags that say "not
# writable", and returns having written nothing.  fprintf(stderr, ...) is four
# bytes off, so _base and _ptr come out of the middle of the previous FILE, and
# writing through those wild pointers stops the process and takes its shell
# with it.  A whole program can therefore print its help and then fail silently
# with a clean exit(1) -- which is exactly how OpenTTD behaved here for hours.
#
# It goes in the specs rather than in CFLAGS because it cannot be optional: one
# translation unit compiled without it disagrees with every other about where
# the fields of a shared struct are, and nothing says so at link time.  It also
# means libgcc and libstdc++ must be built by a compiler that already has this
# spec installed -- see toolchain/build-cross.sh.
replace("cc1", "%(cc1_cpu) -Wno-error=implicit-int")
# self_spec, not cc1: it rewrites the command line for EVERY language, so C,
# C++ and libgcc's own compiles all get it from one place.  Guarded on
# -mno-align-int so the flag can still be turned off deliberately -- useful for
# proving the fault again, useless by accident.
